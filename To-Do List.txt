Now:
- Add an alert system (enemies wont just follow you if you are far away from them)
- Change the time for when the enemy is vulnerable
- Add an question mark when the enemy is suspect
- Add an Exclamation mark when the enemy is alerted and also make him jump a bit when he does that

Earlier Later:
- red stroke around the screen when the health is low

Later:
After new player texture is done to this {
- More arm Variants for player
- At certain health points the texture changes to a sliced version of the same object
}
After you make an alert system:
- Add a Check mark on top of the enemies head and make them do a little jump when they get alerted
- When an enemy hits you when you are blocking them just in time, play a sound and make them get back a bit
- When stunned when you try to move the camera will move slightly to the side you are clicking on

Later Later:
- Add Enchantments to weapons
 - After a lot of mechanics are made, make a Tutorial Level

Maybe:
- add a stealth system so more players will try the game (Ill do this depending on what type of game this will end up)
- Make a gadget that makes you go back in time (costs mana and is for a short amount of time)
- Add an skill that will let you return the arrow to you after you shot it and can also hit enemies while doing that

More Enemy AI Variants:
using my new texture Ill make an enemy that runs at you really fast and if you block his attack just in time he will get knocked out and you'll be able to kill him and if not you'll get damaged and stunned

change the players' health's design and position to something more modern:
- Make it better
